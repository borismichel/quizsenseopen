The entire code is written in typescript and runs on node.js. To run your own copy do the following:

Download the repo (see above)

Extract and `run npm install` from inside the main directory (where package.json is)

Enter the configuration for your telegram bot and Qlik Sense connection in ´./src/config/config.ts´

Run `tsc` in the main directory to compile your code.

Run `node ./dist/app.js`

Happy Quizing!!
